#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This is O(n) because the while loop runtime will increase. it will equal n \* n. linear run time

b) This is O(n log (n)). This is because of the nested while loopp in the for loop. The for loop will run n times and while loop will run O(log n) times because j is incrementing by doubling its value with each loop.

c) This is also O(n). This is because it is just reducing number of bunnies by one with each recursive call

## Exercise II
